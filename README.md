# SHM Data Validation Tool

A standalone desktop application for validating structured data files (e.g., CSVs) against custom configuration rules. Built for reliability and ease of use, the tool is designed to streamline validation workflows for SHM-related data entry and auditing.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è What It Does

- Loads and validates data files like `Students.csv`, `Vaccines.csv`, etc.
- Applies rule-based validation based on project-specific JSON config files
- Provides real-time feedback and error logs in a GUI interface
- Supports dynamic rule sets like required columns, data types, acceptable values, and custom validators

---

## üöÄ How to Use It

Once the app is built as an `.exe`:

1. **Double-click** the executable to launch
2. **Load your CSV/XLSX file** via the file picker
3. The tool will automatically:
   - Load the corresponding config
   - Run validations
   - Display results with visual cues
4. Optionally export a validation log if errors are found
